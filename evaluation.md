# Usability Evaluation

The basket has been fixed by updating the count of items in the basket whenever the page is reloaded or an item is added. This now conforms to Nielsen's 1st heuristic - visibility of system status - so the user does not continuously add items to the basket, expecting some visible response from the site.

The navigation has been updated from the unconventional sidebar to a more conventional top navbar. The page title takes you back to the shop 'home' page, and the basket has a basket icon to help the user identify it, conforming to Nielsen's 2nd heuristic - matching the system to the real world. The conventional navbar conforms to Nielsen's 4th heuristic - consitency and standards - as this is what most desktop websites use, which allows a user to already know how to use the page without having to learn.
